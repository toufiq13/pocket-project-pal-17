```typescript
// Add IoT metadata to products
await supabase.from('products').update({
  iot_compatible: true,
  smart_features: ['voice_control', 'app_control', 'automation']
}).eq('id', productId);
```

#### Phase 2: Smart Home Filters
```typescript
// Filter for IoT-compatible products
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*')
  .eq('iot_compatible', true);
```

#### Phase 3: Integration APIs

**Potential Integrations:**

1. **Amazon Alexa**

const recommendSmartProducts = async (existingDevices) => {
  // ML model suggests products based on:
  // - User's existing smart home ecosystem
  // - Compatibility requirements
  // - Room type and layout
};
```
